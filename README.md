# automatic-question-genrator-from-given-text
This is a challenging era thanks to the expansion within the field of technology and also the demand we face today. 
Hence examinations play an important role in testing students’ performance. which is why it's important to possess a 
wise development question model for the expansion of scholars additionally on test their learning skills thereby keeping 
a check on student performance. Now the normal method of generating question paper has been manual. during this method, 
certain officials sketch the question paper. But this method is ineffective sometimes as a result of bias, repetition, 
and security concerns. we've got proposed an automatic process of Question Paper Generation that's fast, streamlined, 
randomized, and secure. Every task performed by this technique is automated so space for storing, bias, and security 
don't seem to be a concern anymore. Our goal is to create an automated system that can take as input a text and 
produce as output questions for assessing a reader’s knowledge of the information in the text. The questions could then be presented 
to a teacher, who could select and revise the ones that he or she judges to be useful. Various NLP libraries such as Spacy, 
NLTK are used for tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, punctuation. Part of Speech tagging is one of the most significant 
parts of natural language processing which helps us to find the proper tag for given text. Using these NLP libraries the 
proposed system performs effectively utilizing paragraphs of text as input. Furthermore, we've proposed a brand-new algorithm 
that ensures total randomization of questions and avoids repetitions. The proposed system may be helpful to several educational 
institutes and NGO-based institutes.
